## About

I worked on this project starting October 2020 to March 2021 for a doctor who had wanted an easier way to manage his patients and writing prescriptions. The existing solutions are very complicated to learn to use and setup. I wanted to create something that would be easier for clinics and doctors to get up running and be easy to learn and use while maintaining patient data safe with encryption.

Website integrated and utilised by private clinics.
